#For this project, I downloaded Spotify's Top 50 data from Kaggle.
#I then imported it into excel and I created a table.
#Finally,I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I imported the Spotify data .csv into SQLite 

#Finally, I explored the data using SQL

/*First, I discovered how many tracks from each artist made it into the top 50*/
SELECT COUNT(track_name), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) DESC;

/*Then, I ran a query to see if there was a correlation between a track's energy and danceability and whether they were popular because of those factors*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(energy),
AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
